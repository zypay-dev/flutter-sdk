## Coding Guidelines

### Dart Style Guide

Follow the official [Dart Style Guide](https://dart.dev/guides/language/effective-dart/style).

### Code Structure

```
lib/
â”œâ”€â”€ src/
â”‚   â”œâ”€â”€ core/              # Core business logic
â”‚   â”‚   â”œâ”€â”€ config/        # Configuration classes
â”‚   â”‚   â”œâ”€â”€ types/         # Type definitions
â”‚   â”‚   â””â”€â”€ payment_client.dart
â”‚   â”œâ”€â”€ provider/          # State management
â”‚   â”œâ”€â”€ widgets/           # UI components
â”‚   â””â”€â”€ utils/             # Utility functions
â””â”€â”€ zypay_flutter_sdk.dart # Public API
```

### Best Practices

1. **Type Safety**: Use strong typing and avoid dynamic types where possible
2. **Null Safety**: Leverage Dart's null safety features
3. **Immutability**: Prefer immutable data structures
4. **Documentation**: Add dartdoc comments for public APIs
5. **Error Handling**: Use proper error handling and validation
6. **Performance**: Optimize for performance and minimize rebuilds
7. **Testing**: Write tests for new functionality
8. **Naming**: Use clear, descriptive names for variables and functions

### Widget Guidelines

- Keep widgets small and focused
- Use const constructors where possible
- Implement proper lifecycle methods
- Handle dispose properly
- Use keys appropriately

### State Management

- Use Provider pattern for state management
- Keep business logic separate from UI
- Use ChangeNotifier for state updates
- Implement proper disposal of resources

## Commit Guidelines

### Commit Message Format

```
<type>(<scope>): <subject>

<body>

<footer>
```

### Types

- `feat`: New feature
- `fix`: Bug fix
- `docs`: Documentation changes
- `style`: Code style changes (formatting, etc.)

Includes wallet connection and transaction processing.

Closes #123
```

```

flutter test --coverage
```

### Writing Tests

- Write unit tests for business logic
- Write widget tests for UI components
- Write integration tests for complete flows
- Aim for high test coverage
- Use mocks and fixtures appropriately

### Test Structure

```dart
import 'package:flutter_test/flutter_test.dart';
import 'package:zypay_flutter_sdk/zypay_flutter_sdk.dart';

void main() {
  group('PaymentClient', () {
    test('should initialize successfully', () {
      // Arrange
      final config = ZypayConfig(token: 'test-token');
      
      // Act
      final client = PaymentClient(config: config);
      
      // Assert
      expect(client, isNotNull);
    });
  });
}
```

## Documentation

### Dartdoc Comments

Use dartdoc comments for public APIs:

```dart
/// Processes a payment transaction for the specified blockchain.
///
/// The [blockchain] parameter specifies which blockchain to use.
/// The optional [packageName] parameter selects a specific package.
///
/// Returns a [Future] that resolves to the created [Transaction].
///
/// Throws [Exception] if the transaction fails to process.
///
/// Example:
/// ```dart
/// final transaction = await client.processTransaction(
///   blockchain: BlockchainType.ton,
///   packageName: PackageName.basic,
/// );
/// ```
Future<Transaction> processTransaction({
  required BlockchainType blockchain,
  PackageName? packageName,
}) async {
  // Implementation
}
```
